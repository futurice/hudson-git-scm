gitScm.sh is a replacement for the Hudson Git SCM plugin which works
unreliably and failed to checkout git-flow style branches such as
feature/foo or hotfix/bar.

NOTE: A newer Git Plugin might work properly, but the version (1.1.6)
available to our existing Hudson installation is not sufficient.


What it does:
 - Checks out the latest source from the given branch
 - Alternatively checks out a given tag
 - Avoids unneccessary cloning

What it does not do:
 - Polling / triggers
 - Fancy error handling in case incorrect branch or tag names are
   specified
